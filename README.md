# Luxart Vehicle Control v3
Over the past months, I have been slowing integrating additonal features into Faction's release (v2.0) of Lt. Caine's Luxart Vehicle Control resource, I would now like to release these to the public.

__Additional Tones ("Siren Mastery"):__
Add support for up to 6 additional vanilla tones: `RESIDENT_VEHICLES_SIREN_WAIL_01,2,3` and `RESIDENT_VEHICLES_SIREN_QUICK_01,2,3`. With a plethora of customization on how LVC works for you. Some examples: an expanded siren set for all to use including custom created sweeps/autocycles, department specific siren such as Paleto using one siren pack and LSPD using another, the options are endless.

__ELS Style Hotkey Assignments:__
Cycle your tones like single player ELS with player definied hotkey assignments. For example use your numrow or numpad to change sirens on the fly.
